###Daub Nab It
Paint manufacturers publish color information about the hues they sell.

This tool compares the colors at the top of the page to those published lists of colors and returns the closest matches.

How to Use Daub Nab It
Click Find Paints. This will search all the paint libraries for matches and display the best results.

If you want to narrow down the search to one brand of paint, you can do so in the Settings menu.

If you intend to actually buy the paint colors, you can click the color you want and an easy-to-use search term will be copied to your clipboard. This can then be pasted into a search bar.

Why Arenâ€™t These
Exact Matches?
The paint companies that publish their color information do so in a format where there are upwards of sixteen and a half million possible colors.

The color list in this project has just a little over eighteen thousand colors.

Some simple arithmetic provides a likelihood of around one in nine hundred that any given randomly generated or carefully selected color will match perfectly with a paint in the list.

How to Search for
Custom Colors
First, get a color in the hexadecimal format. The excellent Coolors is a great way to generate hues.

Once you have a color description in hexadecimal format (for example, #ECF4FE or ecf4fe), simply copy the text.

Click on a large color box at the top of the page. Your browser should ask for permission to access your clipboard, and you should allow this.

Caveats
These color lists don't completely correspond to what is available for purchase. You may discover that the color is no longer manufactured, was never manufactured, or is only available for a special type of client.

If you're copying these color names down and then going to a store in person, copy a few names for each search. This will save you trips.

You may also discover that the person behind the counter isn't happy about you coming in with the name of a color instead of just grabbing a swatch from the display like everyone else.

This can lead to all sorts of tense standoffs where you, the person who is about to spend hours changing the entire look and feel of your living space, has to convince them, the person that gives every impression that they are being paid to protect paint from the likes of you... to sell you paint.
