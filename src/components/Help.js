      <h1>Daub Nab It</h1>
      <p>Paint manufacturers publish color information about the hues they sell.
      <br />
      <br />
        This tool compares the colors at the top of the page to those published lists of colors and returns the closest matches.</p>
      <h2>How to Use Daub Nab It</h2>
      <p>
        Click Find Paints. This will search all the paint libraries for matches and display the best results.
          <br />
          <br />
        If you want to narrow down the search to one brand of paint, you can do so in the Settings menu.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you intend to actually buy the paint colors, you can click the color you want and an easy-to-use search term will be copied to your clipboard. This can then be pasted into a search bar.
        </p>
      <h2>Why Arenâ€™t These<br/> Exact Matches?</h2>
      <p>The paint companies that publish their color information do so in a format where there are upwards of sixteen and a half million possible colors.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The color list in this project has just a little over eighteen thousand colors.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Some simple arithmetic provides a likelihood of around one in nine hundred that any given randomly generated or carefully selected color will match perfectly with a paint in the list.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Search for <br/>Custom Colors</h2>
      <p>
        First, get a color in the hexadecimal format. The excellent  <a href='https://coolors.co' target='_blank'>Coolors</a> is a great way to generate hues.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once you have a color description in hexadecimal format (for example, #ECF4FE or ecf4fe), simply copy the text.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Click on a large color box at the top of the page. Your browser should ask for permission to access your clipboard, and you should allow this.
       </p>
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>
          These color lists don't completely correspond to what is available for purchase. You may discover that the color is no longer manufactured, was never manufactured, or is only available for a special type of client.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          If you're copying these color names down and then going to a store in person, copy a few names for each search. This will save you trips.
        <br/>
        <br/>
          Also, just because a paint is in this list doesn't mean a store carries that color of paint. Or, the store may have that color paint, but not by that name in their database.
